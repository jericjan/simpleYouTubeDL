# simpleYouTubeDL
A small GUI program I made with python. I have almost zero knowledge in Python, which is why it's terrible. I also don't know how Github works so please forgive me. There are two versions. One where you can just download the video with the quality you want and one where you can also download the subtitles.
YOU'LL NEED FFMPEG AND YOUTUBE-DL INSTALLED BEFORE RUNNING!
